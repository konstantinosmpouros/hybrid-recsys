# artifacts/

Auto-generated outputs: each model notebook (03–13) trains its model into `models/` and
appends its metrics to `metrics/all_metrics.json`; `14_advanced_eval.ipynb` renders the
comparison + deep-evaluation `figures/`.
No files in `models/` or `metrics/` are tracked by git.

## models/

Serialised model objects saved with `joblib`. Loaded at runtime by `RecommenderBundle`.

| File | Class | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `content_model.joblib` | `ContentBasedRecommender` | Fitted item-item cosine similarity model |
| `user_knn_model.joblib` | `UserKNNModel` | Surprise KNNWithMeans, user-based |
| `item_knn_model.joblib` | `ItemKNNModel` | Surprise KNNWithMeans, item-based |
| `svd_model.joblib` | `SVDModel` | Surprise SVD with tuned hyperparameters |
| `weighted_hybrid.joblib` | `WeightedHybrid` | α·SVD + (1−α)·CB with tuned α |
| `stacked_hybrid.joblib` | `StackedHybrid` | Ridge meta-learner trained on OOF predictions |

## metrics/

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `all_metrics.json` | RMSE, MAE, P@K, R@K, F1@K for every model — loaded by the Streamlit app |

## figures/

Plotly charts exported as HTML (always) and PNG (if kaleido is installed).
These are tracked by git as reference outputs.
